                <h1>Information</h1>
                <p>East5th is a web development and consultation company dedicated to building real-world solutions to real-world problems. While our bread and butter is developing reactive web applications targeted towards modern web browsers, we understand that every problem is unique and requires a unique solution. We believe in using iterative development practices to provide as much up-front value as possible, while keeping future improvements in mind.</p>
                <p>The best way to build software is to truly understand the motivation behind its creation. This kind of understanding is built through a relationship of open, honest communication with our clients. For this reason, East5th's founder, <a href="http://1pxsolidtomato.com/">Pete Corey</a>, spearheads all projects and brings in additional resources only when necessary.</p>
