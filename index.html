                <h1>Information</h1>
                <p>East5th is a web development and consultation company dedicated to building real-world solutions to real-world problems. While our bread and butter is developing reactive web applications targeted towards modern web browsers, we understand that every problem is unique and requires a unique solution. We believe in using iterative development practices to provide as much initial value as possible, while keeping future improvements in mind.</p>
                <p>We believe that the best way to build software is to truly understand the motivation behind its creation. This kind of understanding is built through a relationship of open, honest communication with our clients. For this reason, East5th's founder, <a href="http://1pxsolidtomato.com/">Pete Corey</a>, spearheads all projects and brings in additional resources only when necessary.</p>

                <h1>Services</h1>
                <p>At East5th, we live for building fully responsive, real-time, single-page web applications targeted at modern web browsers. While our current preferred technology stack is <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>, we have extensive experience with a variety of front and back-end frameworks like <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>.</p>
                <p>We use a vast array of tools to do our work, but at the end of the day our goal is simplicity. We strive to create the most straight forward and intuitive solution possible to any given problem.</p>
                <p><span class="blockquote">Simplicity is the final achievement. After one has played a vast quantity of notes and more notes, it is simplicity that emerges as the crowning reward of art.</span></p>
